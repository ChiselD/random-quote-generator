Hi! This is the first intermediate-level front-end development project from FreeCodeCamp.com â€“ a random quote generator. It is not an original concept, but it is entirely my own original code.

The user stories for this project are as follows (copied from the website):

User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
